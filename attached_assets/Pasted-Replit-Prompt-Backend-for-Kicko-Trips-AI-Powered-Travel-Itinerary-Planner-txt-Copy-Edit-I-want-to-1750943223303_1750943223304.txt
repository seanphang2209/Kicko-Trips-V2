Replit Prompt: Backend for Kicko Trips (AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Planner)
txt
Copy
Edit
I want to build a full backend API service for my AI travel assistant app called ‚ÄúKicko Trips‚Äù.

The backend should be built using:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modular folder structure
- Support for REST API endpoints
- Sample (mocked) data for destinations, activities, restaurants
- Future-proofed for external API integrations (OpenAI, weather, maps)

---

‚úÖ Features to include:

1. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /generate-itinerary`: Accepts user input and returns a personalized itinerary
   - `GET /dropdowns`: Returns metadata for dynamic dropdowns (destinations, trip types, dietary needs, etc.)

2. **Smart AI Logic (Mocked)**
   - Parse user input: destination, dates, trip type, pace, preferences
   - Simulate day-by-day itinerary generation
   - Randomly assign weather
   - Match appropriate activities, meals, experiences
   - Include a reasoning/explanation for each suggestion
   - Attach optional action links (book, reserve)

3. **Folder Structure**
/kicko-backend
/routes
itinerary.js
dropdowns.js
/controllers
generateItinerary.js
getDropdowns.js
/utils
aiLogic.js
weatherSimulator.js
sampleData.js
app.js
package.json
.env (support for API keys later)

4. **Middleware & Configs**
- Enable CORS for frontend connection
- Support JSON request body parsing (`express.json()`)
- Add dummy environment variable support with `dotenv`

5. **Run instructions**
- Add `"start": "node app.js"` to `package.json` scripts
- Console log when server starts (e.g. "Kicko backend running on http://localhost:3000")

"tripType": ["Relaxation", "Foodie"],
"pace": "Easy",
"budget": "Medium",
"groupType": "Couple",
"dietaryRestrictions": ["Halal"],
"mustSee": ["Uluwatu Temple"],
"avoid": ["Nightclubs"]
}

{
  "tripSummary": {
    "destination": "Bali",
    "days": 4,
    "weather": "30¬∞C, humid with light showers",
    "style": "Relaxation + Foodie"
  },
  "itinerary": [
    {
      "day": "Day 1",
      "summary": "Beach intro and halal-friendly dinner",
      "activities": [
        {
          "time": "2:00 PM",
          "title": "Check-in at Canggu Villa",
          "reason": "Quiet retreat ideal for couples and relaxation."
        },
        {
          "time": "4:00 PM",
          "title": "Sunset at Uluwatu Temple",
          "reason": "One of your must-see picks; sunset is the best time.",
          "action": {
            "label": "Book sunset tour",
            "url": "https://klook.com/search/Uluwatu%20sunset"
          }
        },
        {
          "time": "7:00 PM",
          "title": "Dinner at halal warung",
          "reason": "Top-rated halal-friendly seafood spot in Jimbaran.",
          "action": {
            "label": "Reserve on Google Maps",
            "url": "https://maps.google.com/..."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
‚ú® Notes:

Use sampleData.js to store dummy activities for multiple cities (e.g. Bali, Tokyo, Paris, Bangkok)

Use weatherSimulator.js to generate mock weather data

Future plan: connect OpenAI API for AI-generated reasoning

Make this backend work with the frontend UI I built in V0 (React)

## ‚úÖ After Running This Prompt in Replit

You‚Äôll have:

- A working backend server
- Two useful endpoints: `/generate-itinerary` and `/dropdowns`
- Dynamic support for multiple destinations
- Simulated smart logic for planning trips
- Readiness to connect to your V0 frontend via GitHub and deploy to Cloudflare if needed

---

Would you like me to now:
- Help you **write the first few actual files (`app.js`, `routes`, etc.)**?
- Show you how to **connect this Replit project to V0‚Äôs frontend via GitHub**?
- Guide you through **deployment to Cloudflare Workers or Pages**?

Let me know what you'd like next!
