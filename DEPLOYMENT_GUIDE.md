# Kicko Trips - Deployment Guide

## Option 1: Deploy to GitHub (Recommended)

Since git operations need to be done manually, here are the exact steps:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it "Kicko-Trips" (or your preferred name)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files Manually
**Option A: Use GitHub Web Interface**
1. On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all project files (or use the file selector)
3. Write commit message: "Complete Kicko Trips AI travel planner"
4. Click "Commit changes"

**Option B: Use Git Commands (if available)**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Kicko Trips AI travel planner"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
